# Sympo
Sympo is just another pet project of mine that supposedly fosters online polls. Start polls and see votes updating in near real-time.
You can find the back-end repo for this project [here](https://github.com/jnafolayan/sympo-server).

# Technology
The frontend was built using React.js, axios for HTTP requests, and Redux for data storage. Styled-components were used to build stylesheets throughout the application.

# Demo
The app is hosted on Netlify at [https://sympo-ui.netlify.com](https://sympo-ui.netlify.com)
